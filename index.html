    <h3>About Me</h3>

  <p>
    I don't really know what to write here, I have always had a hard time defining myself because I am constantly changing / transforming. I am a very socially conscious human, forming part of solutions for the improvement of my community however I can. I am usually involved half the time in social work and half the time in the art and music industries. I am very passionate about educating humans for the sake of waking them up out of their vegetable torpers. I am very detail-oriented, methodical, and meticulous in how I carry out my responsibilities. <br>

    <h3>Goals</h3>
    <p>My goals aren't particularly defined right now.
      I suspect that is because I do not know what kind of opportunities are at my fingertips with the dexterity I am acquiring through this course. Ideally I would like to be designing really badass web sites that are very functional and stand out for not only the high-quality functionality, but for my artistic vision as well.</p>
